# Space Explorer React Native App

This project was created for educational purposes and has no affiliation with NASA.

I created this project to serve as the "mobile" version of my Space Explorer React Js project (see repository here:( https://github.com/Gabriel-Moraes-CAD/react-projects.git )

### The user choose a date range (YYYY-MM-DD) and the App will use the APOD API from NASA to generate 1 picture per day, based on the date range input.

### Some pictures are copyrighted protected (from 3rd party photographers). The photo is hidden, however, the user can still read the description by clicking on the picture icon.

### All the other pictures can be seen, in a larger format, along with the description, by clicking on the picture icon.
